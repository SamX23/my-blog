Yes, you read it right, an ultimate blog. I know every web developer wants to create his website, using the tech he wants, a design one desires, and a feature he needs.

That is exactly what I'm gonna do, I challenged myself to create my blog without another people template, by using a tech stack of Next js, Typescript, Material-UI, and so on. Specifically, it should include :

- React Js (I love this one)
- SEO (SSR to be, I hope it works fine)
- Contain my profile and portfolio

At this moment, I can't let myself not code every day, so I always spend a line or two codes in some projects. I believe I can be a better developer and better at managing my time.

So that is it! Let's see what the result would like from time to time.

Salam, Sami :)
