Hi, just about one week ago my daily routine has changes. I got accepted as a new front end developer on company where I work as Technical Support before. It is such an awesome feeling and a great news for me, the day when I was work as TS 8 hours a week and spend the rest to code as hobby is become a full day coding. I even almost miss my daily commit on github.

So let's pray I can keep up the task, learn something new, helping people and prove that I worth the job. Gonna update this blog as soon as possible.

Cheers, from a brand new front end developer. :)
