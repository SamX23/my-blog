# Sami's Ultimate Blog

Hi, I challenge myself to create a website using most updated stack at the moment (2020) and rigid code using Next js, typescript and material-ui(at the moment). I will try to optimize the website as far as I learn and implement many things that can deliver this website to the best I ever created at that moment (2020).

## Development

```bash
# install dependencies
npm run

# serve with hot reload for development
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build

# run check (prettier check)
npm run format
```

## To do

- Gonna be upgraded into blog v2
- Not gonna have feature update for this repository
