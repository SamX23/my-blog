# Sami's Ultimate Blog

Hi, I challenge myself to create a website using most updated techstack and rigid code using Next js, typescript and material-ui(at the moment). I will try to optimize the website as far as I learn and implement many things that can deliver this website to the best I ever created.

## Development

I recommend using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) with node version >= 14.0.0

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload for development
yarn dev

# build for production
yarn build

# run check (prettier check)
yarn format
```

## To do

- Profile (Common information, certificate and sosmed)
- PWA ?
- More animation ?
- GraphQL ?
